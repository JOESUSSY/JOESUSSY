Hello there! I am a dipshit that is trying their fucking best to learn Rust.
I wanna get into game engine development, like doing graphics, physics, and other complex shit.
Let's get back to earth, though. Currently I am in the process of learning the language, so my current ambitions involve making GUIs for terminal apps and just dumb prototypes to test my knowlege on concepts
